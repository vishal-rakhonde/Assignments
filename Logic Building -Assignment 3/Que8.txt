What does the following program print?
// This is the Hello Mumbai program in Java
class HelloMumbai {
public static void main (String args[]) {
String name = "Mumbai";
/* Now let's say hello */
System.out.println("Hello + name");
}
*/
Ans--> here the classname is HelloMumbai,
	in this program string is given to name variable i. e. "Mumbai".
	it will print output--"Hello + name".
	because sop will print only written in double quotation mark.
