/*Assume getnumber(); returns a number entered by a user. What does the following piece of
code do?
do {
int i = getnumber();;
System.out.println(i);
} while {i != 0);*/

/*Ans:- In this code there is input from a method i.e. getnumber() ,so the value from the method is 
assigned to the variable i,
here we used do while loop which has speciality of executing the loop at first after that
it checks the condition it means the loop is executed once in any condition.
the do while loop from above snippet indicates that the loop will be executed until the value of i 
is equal to zero ,if we didn't give any terminating condition it will be infinite */

//following is the snippet
class Que7{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		
		int i=50;
		do{
			System.out.println(i);
			i--;
		}while(i!=0);
	}
}
