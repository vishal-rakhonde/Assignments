//Q1. What is wrong with the following piece of code?

class Que1{
	public static void main(String[] Args){
		int i=10;
		while(i<5){
			i++;
			System.out.println(i);
		}
	}
}

Ans--?In this program we have
declearted value of i is 10
and the condition for while loop is that i should 
be smalled than 5 to execute the loop
but value is greater than 5 so loop will not executed
