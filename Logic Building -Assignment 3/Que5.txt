/*5.Assume getnumber(); returns a number entered by a user. What does the following piece of
code do?

int i = getnumber();
while (i < 10) {
	i++;
int j = getnumber();
if (j ==0) {break;}
else if (j==1) {continue;}
System.out.println(i);
}
System.out.println("finished");
*/
Ans-->here getnumber() is method in which user can give input from command line .
	if the number i is less than 10 then the loop will executed ,either it will print finished.
	when the loop get executed at that time the i is postincrement then the j is assiened 
	to the getnumber value.
	there is if condition occours if j is equal to 0 then it will break the loop and
	if j is equal to 1 then it will continue the loop after this it will print the i value and
	print finished.
